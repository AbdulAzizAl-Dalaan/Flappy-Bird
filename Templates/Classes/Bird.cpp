     *               has a constant upward force for the jump. Also loads in

     *  Description: As long as the bird object is above the maximum height limit,
     *               fall() will increase the objects velocity by adding the gravity
     *               constant to it. This is found in the first 'if' statement. The
     *               proceeding else-if detects if the bird struck the ground (the
     *               maximum HEIGHT limit).
     *
     *               For any external detections, like a collision
     *               with a pipe, fall() will check if the bird was relocated to its origin
     *               and if another function updated the state to LOSE and prevent the velocity
     *               from being altered.
