 *               If they overlap then the enemy is considered hit and the private members of enemy are
 *               update accordingly. Also the +35 and -35 for enemy position are meant to get a range
 *               of values as opposed to simply the enemy's center. It also makes the hit box bigger
 *               for the enemy.
